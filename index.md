# T4Config

A down and dirty way to have strongly typed Config Settings and Connection Strings using in your projects by using T4.

In a nutshell we create an interface called IConfigurations/ IConnectionStrings, so you can do all your fancy DI/IoC stuff, and a concrete implementation called Configurations/ ConnectionStrings. (both names totally customizable.

The T4 template loops through the web.config (or app.config) appSettings and generates a read only property for each key and returns the values placed in the settings value.

If you have a configuration section of appSettings which looked like this;

```xml
<appSettings>
    <add key="Key1" value="value1" />
    <add key="Key2" value="2212DE83-DFC3-44A8-81BA-0A8D132C1F79" />
    <add key="Key3" value="42" />
</appSettings>
```

After the T4 file compiles you would end up with this;

```csharp
public interface IConfigurations
{
    string Key1 { get; }
    Guid Key2 { get; }
    int Key3 { get; }
}

public class Configurations : IConfigurations
{
    public virtual string Key1 
    {
        get 
        {
            return ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Key1"];
        }
    }
    public virtual Guid Key2 
    {
        get 
        {
            return new Guid(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Key2"]);
        }
    }
    public virtual int Key3 
    {
        get 
        {
            return Convert.ToInt32(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Key3"]);
        }
    }
}
```

Same goes for connection strings as well!

##Install
Can be install from Nuget as well;

    Install-Package T4Config

## How do I do it?
- Copy the Configurations.tt file from the src directory to your project.
- Update the configFile value to the proper config file (web or app).
- Right click on the file and click "Run Custom Tool".

Enjoy!
